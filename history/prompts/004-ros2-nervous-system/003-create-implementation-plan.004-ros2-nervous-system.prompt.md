# PHR: Create implementation plan for Part 1 - The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## PROMPT_TEXT

$ARGUMENTS

## RESPONSE_TEXT

Successfully created the implementation plan for Part 1 - The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2). The plan includes:

1. Completed the main plan.md file with:
   - Summary of the feature
   - Technical context with language versions, dependencies, and constraints
   - Constitution check with all 17 rules verified
   - Project structure for documentation and content
   - ROS 2 workspace structure for examples

2. Created research.md with:
   - ROS 2 architecture and core concepts
   - Robot description and visualization (URDF/Xacro, RViz2)
   - Package development and build system (colcon, launch files)
   - AI-agent to ROS 2 integration details
   - Content structure and word counts
   - Technical implementation requirements

3. Created data-model.md with:
   - Content entities (overview, chapters, self-assessment)
   - ROS 2 entities (nodes, topics, services, URDF models, launch files)
   - Content relationships and dependency chains
   - Validation rules for content and technical aspects
   - State transitions for development workflow

4. Created quickstart.md with:
   - Prerequisites and system requirements
   - Content development workflow
   - ROS 2 development patterns and templates
   - Content quality standards
   - Building and testing instructions
   - Integration with Physical AI concepts
   - Next steps for implementation

5. Created contracts/ directory for future API contracts

The plan is now complete and ready for the next phase: creating the task breakdown with /sp.tasks.

## OUTCOME

The implementation plan is fully completed with all Phase 0 and Phase 1 artifacts created according to the specification requirements.

## EVALUATION

All required components have been created following the template structure and meeting the requirements specified in the feature specification.
