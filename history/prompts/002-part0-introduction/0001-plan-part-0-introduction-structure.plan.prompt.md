## Prompt

for 002-part0-introduction

## Response snapshot

Executed complete planning workflow for Part 0 Introduction document structure feature:

**Phase 0 - Research (Completed)**:
- Queried Context7 MCP for official Docusaurus 3.9.2 documentation
- Verified frontmatter schema: id, title, sidebar_label, description
- Verified sidebar configuration patterns
- Verified MDX file structure and UTF-8 encoding for em dash character
- Documented all findings in research.md with official source links

**Phase 1 - Design (Completed)**:
- Created data-model.md defining 4 entities: IntroductionDocument, ChapterDocument, SidebarCategory, DocumentFrontmatter
- Documented file structure, frontmatter schemas, validation rules, and relationships
- Created quickstart.md with 8-step implementation guide including verification steps
- Skipped contracts/ (not applicable - no APIs)
- Updated CLAUDE.md with active technologies via update-agent-context.sh script

**Constitution Check (All Pass)**:
- Rule 1 (Spec-Driven): ✅ PASS
- Rule 2 (Real-Time Verification): ✅ PASS (Context7 used for Docusaurus docs)
- Rule 4 (Code Quality): ✅ PASS (kebab-case filenames)
- Rule 10 (Docusaurus+MDX): ✅ PASS
- Rule 12 (Stop on Ambiguity): ✅ PASS
- Rule 13 (Pedagogical): ⚠️ DEFERRED (empty structure only)
- Rule 14 (Strict Adherence): ✅ PASS (exactly 3 MDX files + 1 sidebar update)
- Rule 16 (Minimalism): ✅ PASS (zero hallucination, all verified)

**ADR Evaluation**: No ADR required (standard Docusaurus conventions, no architectural significance)

**Key Decisions**:
1. Manual sidebar configuration in sidebars.js (vs autogenerated) for exact title control
2. Kebab-case filenames with em dash preserved in frontmatter/labels
3. Empty MDX files with frontmatter only (per spec: "no writing only structure")
4. UTF-8 encoding for em dash (—) character support

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete planning artifacts generated for Part 0 Introduction structure. Ready for /sp.tasks to generate implementation tasks.
- 🧪 Tests: No code tests yet (structure planning only). Build/dev server tests defined in quickstart.md for implementation phase.
- 📁 Files: 4 planning files created (plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md) + 1 updated (CLAUDE.md)
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.tasks to generate implementation tasks from plan
- 🧠 Reflection: Context7 MCP integration worked excellently for real-time Docusaurus documentation verification (Rule 2). All technical facts sourced from official docs with high confidence.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None. Workflow executed cleanly with Context7 providing authoritative Docusaurus documentation.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A (planning phase, no code implementation yet)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.plan workflow execution
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed with /sp.tasks to test task generation from comprehensive plan artifacts
