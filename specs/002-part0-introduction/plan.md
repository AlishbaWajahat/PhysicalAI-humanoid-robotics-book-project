# Implementation Plan: Part 0 Introduction Document Structure

**Branch**: `002-part0-introduction` | **Date**: 2025-12-05 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-part0-introduction/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Create foundational document structure for Part 0 ("Introduction to physical AI and humanoid robotics") with two chapters using Docusaurus 3.x MDX format. Files will contain proper frontmatter but empty content bodies, enabling immediate authoring workflow. Sidebar navigation will be configured to display hierarchical structure with exact titles including em dash (—) characters.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: MDX (Markdown + JSX) for Docusaurus 3.9.2
**Primary Dependencies**: Docusaurus 3.9.2, @mdx-js/react ^3.0.0, React ^19.0.0
**Storage**: File system (`docs/` directory with MDX files)
**Testing**: Manual verification via `npm start` and `npm run build`
**Target Platform**: Web (Node.js >=20.0 for build, any modern browser for runtime)
**Project Type**: Documentation site (Docusaurus)
**Performance Goals**: Fast build times (<30s), instant page navigation (SPA)
**Constraints**:
- UTF-8 encoding required for em dash (—) character
- Kebab-case filenames per Rule 4
- No content generation (structure only per spec)
- Exact title matching per FR-011
**Scale/Scope**: 3 MDX files (1 intro + 2 chapters), 1 sidebar configuration update

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Rule 1: Specification-Driven Development Only
✅ **PASS** - This work originates from approved spec at `specs/002-part0-introduction/spec.md` created via `/sp.specify`

### Rule 4: Code Quality Enforcement Non-Negotiable
✅ **PASS** - All filenames will use kebab-case as required:
- `part0-introduction.mdx` (main intro file)
- `chapter-1-why-physical-ai-is-the-next-frontier.mdx`
- `chapter-2-the-new-workflow-spec-driven-physical-ai.mdx`

### Rule 10: Docusaurus + MDX Native Content Only
✅ **PASS** - All content authored in MDX compatible with Docusaurus 3.9.2

### Rule 12: Immediate Stop on Ambiguity
✅ **PASS** - Spec explicitly defines:
- Exact titles with em dash characters
- File structure requirements
- Sidebar hierarchy
- Empty content requirement

### Rule 13: Pedagogical Structure Mandatory
⚠️ **DEFERRED** - This feature creates only document structure (empty files). Pedagogical requirements (learning objectives, prerequisites, worked examples) will be addressed during content authoring phase per Rule 14 (strict scope adherence).

### Rule 14: Strict Adherence to User Instructions
✅ **PASS** - User explicitly requested "no writing only structure" - plan creates exactly 3 empty MDX files with frontmatter and 1 sidebar update, nothing more.

### Rule 16: Smart Minimalism and Anti-Hallucination
✅ **PASS** - No invention required. Docusaurus conventions are well-documented and will be verified against official 3.9.2 docs.

    └── chapter-2-the-new-workflow-spec-driven-physical-ai.mdx # Chapter 2

sidebars.js                                                  # Updated with Part 0 structure
```

**Structure Decision**: Using Docusaurus standard `docs/` directory with feature-specific subdirectory `part0-introduction/`. Sidebar configured manually in `sidebars.js` (not autogenerated) to ensure exact title control and hierarchical display. No category JSON files needed since sidebar explicitly defines structure.

## Complexity Tracking

No constitutional violations requiring justification. All requirements align with project standards.

## Post-Phase 1 Constitution Re-Check

*Required gate after Phase 1 design (research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md generated)*

### Rule 1: Specification-Driven Development Only
✅ **PASS** - All design artifacts (research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md) derive directly from approved spec. No scope expansion.

### Rule 2: Real-Time Documentation Verification Mandatory
✅ **PASS** - All Docusaurus technical details verified against official documentation via Context7 MCP tool:
- Library: `/websites/docusaurus_io` (High reputation, 7858 snippets)
- Verified frontmatter schema from https://docusaurus.io/docs/3.6.3/create-doc
- Verified sidebar configuration from https://docusaurus.io/docs/3.5.2/sidebar/items
- Verified MDX structure from https://docusaurus.io/docs/3.5.2/markdown-features/head-metadata
- Verification date: 2025-12-05

### Rule 4: Code Quality Enforcement Non-Negotiable
✅ **PASS** - Filenames designed per kebab-case requirement. No code quality tools needed (MDX content only). IEEE citations not applicable (no external references in empty structure files).

### Rule 10: Docusaurus + MDX Native Content Only
✅ **PASS** - All files are `.mdx` format compatible with Docusaurus 3.9.2 and @mdx-js/react ^3.0.0

### Rule 12: Immediate Stop on Ambiguity
✅ **PASS** - No ambiguities encountered during planning. All decisions documented with rationale in research.md.

### Rule 13: Pedagogical Structure Mandatory
⚠️ **DEFERRED** - Still deferred. Empty structure files contain no pedagogical content. This rule applies during content authoring (future feature).

### Rule 14: Strict Adherence to User Instructions
✅ **PASS** - Design strictly adheres to "no writing only structure" requirement:
- 3 MDX files with frontmatter only
- Optional h1 heading (for authoring convenience)
- No Lorem ipsum, placeholder text, or TODO comments
- Exactly 1 sidebar configuration update
- Nothing beyond explicit spec requirements

### Rule 16: Smart Minimalism and Anti-Hallucination
✅ **PASS** - Zero hallucination risk:
- All technical facts verified via Context7 against official Docusaurus docs
- No invented APIs, package names, or configurations
- Data model documents actual file structure (no abstractions)
- Quickstart provides concrete implementation steps verified against package.json

### ADR Evaluation

**Three-part significance test**:
1. **Impact**: Long-term consequences? ❌ No - Simple file structure with standard Docusaurus conventions
2. **Alternatives**: Multiple viable options? ❌ No - Docusaurus has one standard approach for docs + sidebar
3. **Scope**: Cross-cutting system influence? ❌ No - Isolated to Part 0 introduction structure

**Result**: No ADR required. This is straightforward application of Docusaurus conventions per project Rule 10.

### Final Gate Status

**All checks PASS or DEFERRED (with justification).** ✅

Planning phase complete. Ready for Phase 2: `/sp.tasks`
